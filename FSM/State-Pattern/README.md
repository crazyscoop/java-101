# State Design Pattern

## Definination
**State** is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

## Design Participants
- **State** : The interface define operations which each state must handle. 
- **Concrete States** : The classes which contain the state specific behavior.
- **Context** : Defines an interface to client to interact. It maintains references to concrete state object which may be used to define current state of object. It delegates state-specific behavior to different State objects.

## When To Use
- Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently.
- Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive ***if-else*** conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.


## What Are The Cons
- A developer needs to write a large amount of code for the state schema. Depending on the number of different defined state transition methods and possible object states, you can write numerous methods. Thus, for N states with M transition methods, the total number of methods required will be **(N+1)xM**.
